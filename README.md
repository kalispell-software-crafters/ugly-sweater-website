# Ugly Sweater Website

For one of our meetups we held a "contest" to create ugly sweater websites in spirit of the Holiday season. Here's the event page for reference: [https://www.meetup.com/Kalispell-Software-Crafters/events/273351215/](https://www.meetup.com/Kalispell-Software-Crafters/events/273351215/).

## Basic Website Template

An absolute minimalist website template that includes the creature comforts we've come to expect (bundling, babel, minifications, etc.).

To use this template you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Setup

- Download this source code
- Navigate to the project directory in a terminal and install dependencies:

  ```sh
    npm install
  ```

## Usage

To start a development server, run:

```sh
  npm start
```

To build the site for production, run:

```sh
  npm run build
```
